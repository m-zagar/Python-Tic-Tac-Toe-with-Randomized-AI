# Python Tic-Tac-Toe with randomized AI
Simple Python app that simulates the game of Tic-Tac-Toe using randomized AI.

The idea was to have the user be the first one to initiate the game, then for the AI to make their own choice. The game is simplified as much as possible, which can be seen by the fact that the user doesn't have the ability of choosing second as well as the AI being fully randomized and with no game plan what so ever.

The code was written in Python, using the "tkinter" library for UI and the "numpy" and "random" libraries for the playing field and move calculations.
